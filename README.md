Image Classification, Object Detection, and Model Training

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This repository showcases my projects involving image classification, object detection, and the creation and training of machine learning models. Below is a brief overview of the projects included and their descriptions.

1. Image Classification Project

This project focuses on classifying images into predefined categories using various machine learning and deep learning techniques. It involves preprocessing the images, building and training the classification models, and evaluating their performance.

**Technologies Used:** 
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Scikit-learn
- OpenCV

2. Object Detection Project

The object detection project aims to detect and locate objects within images or video frames. It utilizes techniques such as region-based convolutional neural networks (R-CNN), You Only Look Once (YOLO), or Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) for accurate object detection.

**Technologies Used:** 
- Python
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- YOLO/SSD

3. Model Creation and Training Project

In this project, I demonstrate the process of creating and training machine learning models from scratch. It includes data collection, preprocessing, model architecture design, hyperparameter tuning, and training/validation/testing phases.

**Technologies Used:** 
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
